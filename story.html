      <h1>Stings</h1>

      <p class="one">one Bare-handed, I hand the combs. The man in white smiles, bare-handed, Our cheesecloth gauntlets neat and sweet, The throats of our wrists brave lilies. He and I<br /><a href="#" class="button two-a">two a</a><br /><a href="#" class="button three-a">Three a</a></p>

      <p class="two-a">two a Have a thousand clean cells between us, Eight combs of yellow cups, And the hive itself a teacup, White with pink flowers on it, With excessive love I enameled it<br /><a href="#" class="button three-a">three a</a><br /><a href="#" class="button two-b">two b</a></p>

      <p class="two-b">two b Thinking ‘Sweetness, sweetness’. Brood cells gray as the fossils of shells Terrify me, they seem so old. What am I buying, wormy mahogany? Is there any queen at all in it?<br /><a href="#" class="button two-c">two c</a><br /><a href="#" class="button three-a">Three a</a></p>

      <p class="two-c">two c If there is, she is old, Her wings torn shawls, her long body Rubbed of its plus Poor and bare and unqueenly and even shameful. I stand in a column<br /><a href="#" class="button two-d">two d</a><br /><a href="#" class="button three-a">Three a</a></p>

      <p class="two-d">two d Of winged, unmiraculous women, Honey-drudgers. I am no drudge Though for years I have eaten dust And dried plates with my dense hair.<br /><a href="#" class="button three-a">three a</a><br /><a href="#" class="button three-b">three-b</a></p>

      <p class="three-a">three a And seen my strangeness evaporate, Blue dew from dangerous skin. Will they hate me, These women who only curry, Whose news is the open cherry, the open clover?<br /><a href="#" class="button three-b">three-b</a><br /><a href="#" class="button two-a">two-a</a></p>

      <p class="three-b">three b It is almost over. I am in control. Here is my honey-machine, It will work without thinking, Opening, in spring, like an industrious virgin<br /><a href="#" class="button three-c">three-c</a><br /><a href="#" class="button two-a">two-a</a></p>

      <p class="three-c">three c To scour the creaming crests As the moon, for its ivory powders, scours the sea. A third person is watching. He has nothing to do with the bee-seller or with me. Now he is gone<br /><a href="#" class="button two-b">two-b</a><br /><a href="#" class="button three-d">Three d</a></p>

      <p class="three-d">three d In eight great bounds, a great scapegoat. Here is his slipper, here is another, And here the square of white linen He wore instead of a hat. He was sweet,<br /><a href="#" class="button four-a">four-a</a><br /><a href="#" class="button three-a">Three-a</a></p>

      <p class="four-a">four a The sweat of his efforts a rain Tugging the world to fruit. The bees found him out, Molding onto his lips like lies, Complicating his features.<br /><a href="#" class="button four-b">four-b</a><br /><a href="#" class="button three-a">Three-a</a></p>

      <p class="four-b">four b They thought death was worth it, but I Have a self to recover, a queen. Is she dead, is she sleeping? Where has she been, With her lion-red body, her wings of glass?<br /><a href="#" class="button four-c">four c</a><br /><a href="#" class="button three-a">three a</a></p>

      <p class="four-c">four c Now she is flying More terrible than she ever was, red Scar in the sky, red comet Over the engine that killed her - The mausoleum, the wax house.<br /><a href="#" class="button one">start over</a><br /><a href="#" class="button two-b">two b</a></p>
